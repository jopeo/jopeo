## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fourth-year medical student at the **Carle Illinois College of Medicine**,
the world's first engineering medical school.

My professional interests include cardiothoracic surgery and medical education.
My research interests include applying technologies such as machine learning 
to both patient care and medical education, with the goal of alleviating administrative
burdens and addressing the learning styles of upcoming generations, to better educate leaders
and provide excellent, patient-centered care.

I am only a novice in computer science with no formal education, so please excuse my
underdeveloped code and leave a comment or suggestion if you see something I can improve.
I have a rudimentary knowledge of python and R and am currently in the process of learning 
Tensorflow's Keras.

Thanks for visiting my repository!
